    "The datasets that consists of this project will be the types of varying majors that are offered in various schools in the United States from across a period of 1900s to present day along with majors in STEM which are shown in categories of race, sex and the level of the degree upon graduation. Alongside these datasets there are the number of employed and unemployed graduates and their major and the market for recent graduates based on major. Based on the datasets we found that STEM majors are becoming more of a focus on the majors by graduation and this growth has been shown in the recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to projects that have already looked at similar datasets we noticed that the Hamilton Project released their findings as they looked at annual earnings over a career by degree and major as they took a dataset with a sample of 80 majors and compared their lifetime earnings. Alongside this they also took a distribution and earnings difference to associate which majors are culminating into higher margins based on percentile for the number of graduates in those majors and comparing these percentiles with different majors. They discovered that even the graduates in the highest earning majors will be out earned by some graduates in majors which on average would be more likely to earn less overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall our project consists of these datasets and we ask the questions of how majors are affected by gender and ethnicity alongside the majors that are becoming more offered and decided by universities across the United States. There are also ethical considerations that link to privacy of data and how we can assure that this data remains private. Lastly we do not pass judgement or measure the worth of a major based on our questions rather we are assessing how this data can help future and current graduates look at majors and find out any questions that might be related to the ones that are being asked and assessed in this project.\n",
